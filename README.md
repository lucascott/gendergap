# HCI 2017 - Gender gap issue project
## Group 06

Our group is thinking about doing an interactive website aimed to inform the user on the gender gap topic. Our goal is to implement useful data in a interesting and fun way using some javascript libraries such as Odyssey and D3. The user will be able to scroll through the data in the page and interact with it. Our focus is to explain how the gender gap appears around the world.

We broke down the task in several activities; for each of them we have allocated a responsible person who will ensure the completion before the deadline. It could be found here: [waffle.io/lucascott/gendergap](http://www.waffle.io/lucascott/gendergap)
